# streamdeck-time-tracker

A StreamDeck plugin for tracking time with Todoist. Provides an action that displays the current running timer and a separate action that starts a timer with specificly configured options. 

This provides an alternative to [blueshiftone/streamdeck-toggl)](https://github.com/blueshiftone/streamdeck-toggl), which only displays running time if the currently running timer matches the timer options it is configured with.

**In development**

## Building

Currently using [just](https://github.com/casey/just). This is not yet completely fleshed out
